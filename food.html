    <strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong>

    <p>Heat water in a large stockpot. Add pork meat, onion, garlic, salt and chicken bullion. Bring to a boil, then
        lower the heat and let simmer, partially
        covered for 2 and half hours or until meat is tender. While cooking, skim the top layer of foam and fat from the
        pot using a strainer. If necessary, add warm
        water to maintain the same level of broth in the pot. Remove pork from broth; reserve broth, onion, and garlic
        from the broth. Trim excess fat, and remove meat
        from bones. Shred meat, and cover.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now for the sauce, soak the ancho, guajillo peppers and chile de arbol in water just enough to cover for 25-30
        minutes until
        soft. Using a blender or food processor blend peppers, garlic cloves(from broth), onion(from broth), and
        oregano, adding some
        of the water in which they were soaking. Puree mixture until smooth.
    </p>
    <p>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add the dry pepper puree and salt for flavor, stirring constantly
        as it splatters.
        Reduce heat to medium; simmer, about 25 minutes. Using a strainer, add the sauce to the broth. Bring to a boil
        and add the meat, and simmer gently, for about 10 minutes.
        Stir in white hominy, and season with salt and pepper. Simmer until heated through. Add more salt, chicken
        bullion or oregano if necessary.
    <p>
        Serve Pozole in large Mexican soup bowls and add garnishes.
    </p>

    <strong>NOTES:</strong>
    <p>
        Chile de arbol is spicy, and a little goes a long way. You can adjust the spice level by adding as much or as
        little as you prefer.
        If you're sensitive to heat, start with a small amount and taste as you go.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to use uncook cacahuazintle corn (hominy) and cook it yourself, rinse the corn, remove any grain
        that looks dry or old.
        Place the corn in a pot with enough water to cover it at least 8-10 centimeters above the corn kernels. Add a
        quarter of a white
        onion, two cloves of garlic, you can also herbs like bay leaves and thyme. Cook for about an hour and a half
        until the corn opens.
        It may take less or longer, it depends on how old the corn is. This is for 1-½ lb. of corn. When the corn is
        already cooked, drain
        it and add it to the pozole as indicated in the recipe.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can prepare the sauce a couple of days in advance so that it is not so elaborate to do it all the same day.
        The sauce can also
        be frozen and used for other stews such as adobos or enchiladas.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Pozole tends to enhance its flavors the next day, so if you are going to prepare it for a party or special
        occasion you can cook it
        in advance, and just reheat it. Besides, it keeps very well in the freezer including the hominy, and it takes
        great when you reheat
        it weeks later.
